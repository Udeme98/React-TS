# React + TypeScript

This repository contains my learning of TypeScript and React.

## What is Typescript

Typescript is a superset of JavaScript, i.e it's JavaScript with added features that helps in writing even more robust codes.

## What is React?

React is a JavaScript Library, used to build highly responsive and scalable user interfaces.(UIs)

## Why Learn Typescript?

1. It improves overall developer's experience. With static type checking, you get to learn about potential bugs as you're writing the code, than heading to the browser and figuring it out at runtime.
2. It's autocomplete feature is **fantastic**.
3. Makes maintainance and refactoring of large code base much easier.
